            My book, Rays of Hope Devotions, came about during our travels in the years
            2000-2011. I wrote a weekly Thought for the Week to email to friends as my way
            of keeping me connected to my faith. I had worked as a volunteer and an employee
            in churches for many years serving in many capacities. Then on the road I had to
            find a way to stay connected. Over the years, other would ask if I was going to
            put them in a book. Finally in 2023, I put all other activities aside and began
            editing and processing all the details to achieve the final product. God
            provided the people necessary to assist me in getting this done as it was such a
            new undertaking for me. The book is now available at Amazon, Barnes and Noble
            and other bookstores in both printed and ebook versions. It is also in my Etsy
            Shop as a signed copy. Of course, I have copies that I can send out or deliver
            to those nearby. Here are some examples of what you can find in the book through
            the Table of Contents as well as a list of the alphabetical listing of all the
            367 devotions with page numbers. You can find three different devotions as
            samples to read here for the style of my writing.
