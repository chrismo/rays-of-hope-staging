            Rays of Hope Quilt came as an answer to my prayers for a special
            quilt to put into the NOMADS live auction in September 2011. On
            Easter Sunday 2011 at 4:30 am I awoke with this design! I laid in
            bed for the next two hours constructing it in my head. Little did I
            know about the journey that design would have for me!
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
            After I got the first one made, a couple of friends asked me to make
            them one before the auction. At the auction it did amazingly well!
            The full story is in my book and on a <a

        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
            As I made another one alongside my other quilting friends, they
            asked for a pattern. That led to a pattern, an Etsy shop <a

            class="underline text-book-purple-600 hover:text-book-purple-800
            visited:text-book-purple-900">Rays of Hope Quilts</a>, and orders
            from many places since 2012.

            The Stained glass version came about six months after the original
            version was published. Fabric kits are available from the <a

            The dark area behind the cross, to me, represents the sin in our
            lives that Jesus died on the cross to cover. The lighter areas
            represent the lives lived in the kingdom of Christ now living in the
            light of Jesus. In the stained glass version the dark areas are also
            colorful as some of the sin in our life is colorful! While life in
            the kingdom is also colorful and alive!
