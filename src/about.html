            Carolyn Ruth Traylor Morris is the daughter of Catherine and Charles
            Traylor (both deceased), wife of Rudy Morris (retired). They have three
            children, 13 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. They currently
            reside in Aurora, CO but have also lived in Arkansas, Texas, Tennessee,
            Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, New Hampshire, on the road in a motorhome,
            Arizona and Colorado. Rudy’s work transferred them to these states until
            retirement in New Hampshire. Carolyn was a stay-at-home Mom for 18 years
            and volunteered at their schools and churches. She and Rudy both met and
            graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Carolyn
            got a BS in Business, Personnel Management. Finally, she went to work
            outside the home as a Director of Christian Education in Ohio and New
            Hampshire. Her work involved at lot of personnel management of
            volunteers, writing, leading bible studies and other stewardship
            activities. After retiring, she took up her interest in designing and
            making quilts, continued writing, and leading bible studies. Their love
            for the outdoors, camping, and being in nature hiking and photographing
            God’s creations resulted from years in Scouting through high school.
            During the Pandemic, they learned how to provide Zoom meetings for
            their Chapel so members could attend. They are both still active in
            their retirement at Heather Gardens, a 55+ active community. You can
            find her work at her Etsy Shop, <a
